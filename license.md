# FalkorDB License

FalkorDB is licensed under the the [Server Side Public License v1 (SSPLv1)](https://github.com/FalkorDB/FalkorDB/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## FalkorDB Licensing FAQ: Understanding the SSPLv1 License

1. What does it mean that FalkorDB is licensed under SSPLv1?

The Server Side Public License (SSPLv1) is designed to ensure that if you use FalkorDB as part of a service you make available to others (e.g., in the cloud or as an API), you are required to make the source code of your complete service available under the SSPLv1 license. This is similar to GPL but extends to server use.

2. Can I use FalkorDB in my internal projects without open-sourcing my code?

Yes! If you're using FalkorDB for internal purposes only—within your organization without providing it as a service to external users—you are not required to open-source your code.

3. Can I use FalkorDB in my closed-source project without open-sourcing the entire project?

If your closed-source project does not make FalkorDB available to external users as part of a service, you can use it without open-sourcing the rest of your code. However, if you provide FalkorDB as part of a service, the SSPLv1 requires you to open-source your codebase associated with the service.

4. How does the SSPLv1 license affect my commercial application that uses FalkorDB?

You can use FalkorDB commercially, but if your application provides FalkorDB as a service to users, then under SSPLv1, you must open-source the code that enables this service. For companies needing a commercial license to avoid this requirement, please contact us to discuss options.

5. What if I want to use FalkorDB in my product but don’t want to release my source code?

If you’re providing a service with FalkorDB and prefer not to release your source code, reach out to our team. We offer commercial licensing options that can accommodate these needs without the open-source requirement.

6. Does the SSPLv1 license affect FalkorDB’s SDKs and other libraries?

The SSPLv1 applies to the core FalkorDB software and any libraries distributed under the same license. We may distribute certain FalkorDB libraries or SDKs under more permissive licenses, so please check each repository for the specific license details.

7. Can I modify FalkorDB under the SSPLv1 license?

Yes! You’re welcome to modify FalkorDB under SSPLv1. If you distribute a modified version as part of a service, however, the SSPLv1 requires that you open-source your modifications.

8. Can I redistribute FalkorDB in my applications without following SSPLv1?

If you redistribute FalkorDB as part of an application that does not make it available as a service, you do not need to open-source your code. But if you’re using FalkorDB as part of a public service, SSPLv1 obligations apply.

9. What should I do if I’m unsure whether SSPLv1 affects my use of FalkorDB?

We’re here to help! If you have questions about specific use cases or licensing terms, feel free to reach out to our team for guidance.

10. Is FalkorDB free to use for evaluation and prototyping?

Yes, you are free to use FalkorDB under SSPLv1 for evaluation, prototyping, and internal testing without needing to release your source code, as long as it's not provided as a public service.
