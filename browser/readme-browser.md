# FalkorDB Browser
FalkorDB Browser is a web UI for exploring, querying, and managing FalkorDB graphs.
It allows a developer to interact with graphs loaded to FalkorDB, explore how specific queries behave and review the current data model.
FalkorDB Browser is integrated within the main falkordb docker, and through the Cloud service as well.

## Main features

### Graph exploration (Graph page)
- **Interactive graph canvas**
  - Visualize query results containing nodes/edges as an interactive graph.
  - Pan/zoom and interact with nodes and relationships.
  - Toggle visibility by **labels** and **relationship types**.
- **Element search (in-canvas search)**
  - Search nodes/edges by:
    - node properties (string prefix match),
    - ids,
    - relationship type,
    - labels.
  - Jump/zoom to the match and select it.
- **Data / inspection panel**
  - Selecting an element opens a side panel for inspecting its properties.
  - Supports editing workflows (see “Data manipulation”).
- **Entity Creation Tools**
  - You can add a node and/or an edge to the current graph from the canvas view.

### Querying
- **Cypher query editor (Monaco)**
  - Editor-style experience for writing Cypher.
  - Keyboard shortcuts include:
    - Run: `Enter` (and `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` in the query-history editor)
    - Insert newline: `Shift + Enter`
  - Includes Cypher keyword/function completion (based on the Browser’s built-in lists).
- **Results views**
  - **Graph view** for node/edge results.
  - **Table view** for tabular results.
- **Query metadata**
  - Metadata tab shows:
    - query metadata text,
    - explain plan (rendered as a nested tree),
    - profile output (rendered as a nested tree).

### Query history
- **Persistent query history** stored in browser `localStorage`.
- **History browser dialog**
  - Search and filter previous queries.
  - Filter by graph name.
  - Delete single queries, multi-select delete, or “delete all”.
- **Per-query metadata**
  - Review metadata / explain / profile for past queries.

### Data manipulation (nodes/relationships)
- **Create node / create relationship** flows from the Graph UI.
- **Delete elements** (node or relationship) from the Graph UI.
- **Label editing** supported via API routes (the UI provides label management components).

### Graph management
- **Create graphs** from the UI.
- **Delete graphs** (supports deleting multiple selected graphs).
- **Duplicate graphs**
  - Create a copy of an existing graph (including data).
- **Export graphs**
  - Download a `.dump` file via the Browser (`/api/graph/:graph/export`).
- **Upload data**
  - “Upload Data” dialog supports drag-and-drop file selection (Dropzone UI).

### Graph Info panel
- **Memory Usage tracking** Exposes current memory utilization of the graph in MB.
- **Node Label tracking** View all node labels in the graph, control style visualization for labels. Click on a node label to trigger a query to visualize nodes from this label.
- **Edge Type tracking** View all edge types in the graph. Click on an edge type to trigger a graph query showing only nodes connected through this edge type.
- **Property Keys tracking** View all property keys in the graph. Click on a key to issue a query that shows nodes and edges where the property exists (not NULL).


### API documentation
- **Built-in Swagger UI** at `/docs`.
  - Loads the Browser’s OpenAPI spec from `/api/swagger`.
  - “Try it out” enabled.
  - Adds an `X-JWT-Only: true` header when calling endpoints from Swagger UI.

### Authentication & access control
- Uses **NextAuth** (credentials-backed) for authentication.
- UI capabilities are role-aware:
  - **Read-Only** users cannot create graphs.
  - **Admin** users can access database configuration and user-management sections in settings.

### Settings
The `/settings` area includes multiple sections:
- **Browser settings**
  - Query execution defaults and limits:
    - timeout
    - result limit
    - run default query on-load
  - User experience:
    - content persistence (auto-save/restore)
    - display-text priority (controls which node property is shown as the node caption)
  - Graph info refresh interval.
  - Tutorial replay.
- **DB configurations** (Admin)
  - View and update server configuration values.
  - Some runtime configurations are intentionally read-only.
- **Users** (Admin)
  - List users and adjust roles.
  - Add and delete users.
- **Personal Access Tokens**
  - Generate tokens (with optional expiration).
  - Tokens are shown once at creation (copy-to-clipboard UX).
  - Revoke existing tokens.

### Optional “Chat” (English → Cypher)
If enabled, the Browser includes a **Chat panel** that streams responses from a text-to-cypher service.
- The UI sends messages to `/api/chat` and processes server-sent events.
- Chat configuration lives in Settings (model + secret key).
- The chat backend URL is controlled by `CHAT_URL`.

## Common workflows
### 1) Run a query and visualize results
1. Go to **Graphs** and select a graph.
2. Write a Cypher query in the editor.
3. Run it.
4. Inspect results in:
   - **Graph** tab (interactive canvas), or
   - **Table** tab (rows/columns).
5. Use **Labels/Relationships toggles** to focus the canvas.

### 2) Inspect and edit an element
1. Click a node/edge in the canvas.
2. Use the **Data panel** to inspect properties.
3. Use create/delete actions as needed.

### 3) Use query history
1. Open **Query History**.
2. Filter by graph, search, and select a previous query.
3. Review **Metadata / Explain / Profile**.

### 4) Export a graph
1. Open graph management.
2. Select a graph.
3. Click **Export Data** to download a `.dump`.
