# Chat Panel
The Chat panel lets you use English (natural language) to query the graph.

## Prerequisites
Chat requires configuring:
- An LLM provider API key
- A model

These are set in **Settings → Browser Settings → Chat**.

## Opening the panel
On the Graphs page (`/graph`), click **CHAT** in the left sidebar.

When Chat is opened, element selection is cleared (the side panel is dedicated to chat interactions).

## Message retention
The number of saved interactions is configurable in settings (the UI enforces a bounded range).
