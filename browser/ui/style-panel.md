# Style Panel
The Style panel ("Style Settings") customizes how nodes of a specific label appear in the graph.

## How to open
1. Open **Graph Info**.
2. Click the palette icon next to a node label.

## What you can change
- **Color**
  - Preset colors
  - Custom color via a red/green/blue color picker
- **Size**
  - Choose from predefined size options

Changes are previewed immediately on the canvas.

## Save vs Cancel
- **Save**
  - Closes the panel.
  - Persists the style to browser storage (localStorage) so the label keeps the style.
- **Cancel / Close**
  - Reverts to the original style values.

## Tutorial note
During the tutorial, saving style changes is intentionally prevented.
