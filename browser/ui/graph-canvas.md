# Main Graph Canvas
The **Graph** results tab renders your query results as an interactive node/edge visualization.

## Core interactions
- **Pan/zoom** the canvas to explore results.
- **Select** nodes/edges to inspect them (opens the Data panel).
- **Right-click / context menu** is used in the tutorial flow to open element details.

## Labels & Relationships filters
When you have results, the overlay includes:
- **Labels** list: toggle visibility of nodes by label.
- **Relationships** list: toggle visibility of edges by relationship type.

These toggles update visibility on the canvas without re-running the query.

## Canvas controls
The controls area includes:
- **Animation control** (play/pause force-layout delay)
- **Zoom in / Zoom out**
- **Center / fit to screen**

## Tabs around the canvas
From the same results region you can switch to:
- **Table** view (when tabular data exists)
- **Metadata** view (when metadata/explain exists)
