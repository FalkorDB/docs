# LLM Framework Integrations

FalkorDB integrates with various LLM frameworks to enhance AI-powered applications with graph database capabilities.

## Graphiti

[Graphiti](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/configuration/graph-db-configuration#falkordb) is a Python framework for building temporally-aware, multi-tenant live knowledge graph designed for multi-agent AI systems with persistent memory. It enables real-time integration of structured and unstructured data, supporting advanced hybrid search, temporal reasoning, and collaborative agent memory.

### FalkorDB's Added Value

- **Multi-tenant, multi-agent memory**: Isolated graph instances for different users or agents, each with their own persistent memory.
- **High performance**: Fast graph operations and efficient memory usage.
- **Cloud and on-premises ready**: Works with FalkorDB Cloud or your own deployment.
- **Easy integration**: Seamless connection with Graphiti for scalable, production-ready knowledge graphs.

### Use Cases

- **AI memory for multi-agent systems**: Provide persistent, context-rich memory for each agent.
- **Enterprise knowledge management**: Aggregate and search across documents, conversations, and structured data.
- **Conversational AI**: Track facts, entities, and relationships over time for more accurate responses.
- **E-commerce**: Manage inventory, personalize recommendations, and track customer interactions over time.
- **Research and analytics**: Temporal and semantic search across large, heterogeneous datasets.

### Quickstart Usage

1. **Install Graphiti**  
   `pip install graphiti-core[falkord-db]`

2. **Connect to your FalkorDB instance**  
   (Cloud or on-premises, see your FalkorDB dashboard for connection details.)

3. **Build indices, add episodes, and search**  
   - Initialize Graphiti with FalkorDB connection.
   - Build indices and constraints.
   - Add episodes (text or JSON).
   - Perform hybrid and node searches.

See the full quickstart example in the [Graphiti repository: examples/quickstart/quickstart_falkordb.py](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart_falkordb.py).

## LangChain

FalkorDB is now integrated with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), bringing powerful graph database capabilities to AI-driven applications. This integration enables the creation of AI agents with memory, enhancing their ability to retain state and context across interactions.

## LangGraph

[LangGraph](https://www.langgraph.dev/) is an open-source framework for building **stateful, multi-actor agentic applications** using LLMs. It allows you to design complex single- and multi-agent workflows as directed graphs, where nodes represent tasks and edges define the information flow.

## LlamaIndex

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of LLM-powered applications. It provides tools for ingesting, indexing, and querying diverse data sources.

In a typical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setup, LlamaIndex orchestrates both the retrieval and generation phases. FalkorDB powers the retrieval module using Cypher queries, while any LLM trained on Cypher can handle the generation stepâ€”making it a natural fit for graph-native workflows.
