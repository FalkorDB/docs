# MATCH

Match describes the relationship between queried entities, using ascii art to represent pattern(s) to match against.

Nodes are represented by parentheses `()`,
and Relationships are represented by brackets `[]`.

Each graph entity node/relationship can contain an alias and a label/relationship type, but both can be left empty if necessary.

Entity structure: `alias:label {filters}`.

Alias, label/relationship type, and filters are all optional.

Example:

```sh
(a:Actor)-[:ACT]->(m:Movie {title:"straight outta compton"})
```

`a` is an alias for the source node, which we'll be able to refer to at different places within our query.

`Actor` is the label under which this node is marked.

`ACT` is the relationship type.

`m` is an alias for the destination node.

`Movie` destination node is of "type" movie.

`{title:"straight outta compton"}` requires the node's title attribute to equal "straight outta compton".

In this example, we're interested in actor entities which have the relation "act" with **the** entity representing the
"straight outta compton" movie.

It is possible to describe broader relationships by composing a multi-hop query such as:

```sh
(me {name:'swilly'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->()-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(foaf)
```

Here we're interested in finding out who my friends' friends are.

Nodes can have more than one relationship coming in or out of them, for instance:

```sh
(me {name:'swilly'})-[:VISITED]->(c:Country)<-[:VISITED]-(friend)<-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(me)
```

Here we're interested in knowing which of my friends have visited at least one country I've been to.

## Variable length relationships

Nodes that are a variable number of relationshipâ†’node hops away can be found using the following syntax:

```sh
-[:TYPE*minHops..maxHops]->
```

`TYPE`, `minHops` and `maxHops` are all optional and default to type agnostic, 1 and infinity, respectively.

When no bounds are given the dots may be omitted. The dots may also be omitted when setting only one bound and this implies a fixed length pattern.

Example:

```sh
GRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH
"MATCH (charlie:Actor { name: 'Charlie Sheen' })-[:PLAYED_WITH*1..3]->(colleague:Actor)
RETURN colleague"
```

Returns all actors related to 'Charlie Sheen' by 1 to 3 hops.

## Bidirectional path traversal

If a relationship pattern does not specify a direction, it will match regardless of which node is the source and which is the destination:

```sh
-[:TYPE]-
```

Example:

```sh
GRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH
"MATCH (person_a:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(person_b:Person)
RETURN person_a, person_b"
```

Returns all pairs of people connected by a `KNOWS` relationship. Note that each pair will be returned twice, once with each node in the `person_a` field and once in the `person_b` field.

The syntactic sugar `(person_a)<-[:KNOWS]->(person_b)` will return the same results.

The bracketed edge description can be omitted if all relations should be considered: `(person_a)--(person_b)`.

## Named paths

Named path variables are created by assigning a path in a MATCH clause to a single alias with the syntax:
`MATCH named_path = (path)-[to]->(capture)`

The named path includes all entities in the path, regardless of whether they have been explicitly aliased. Named paths can be accessed using [designated built-in functions](#path-functions) or returned directly if using a language-specific client.

Example:

```sh
GRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH
"MATCH p=(charlie:Actor { name: 'Charlie Sheen' })-[:PLAYED_WITH*1..3]->(:Actor)
RETURN nodes(p) as actors"
```

This query will produce all the paths matching the pattern contained in the named path `p`. All of these paths will share the same starting point, the actor node representing Charlie Sheen, but will otherwise vary in length and contents. Though the variable-length traversal and `(:Actor)` endpoint are not explicitly aliased, all nodes and edges traversed along the path will be included in `p`. In this case, we are only interested in the nodes of each path, which we'll collect using the built-in function `nodes()`. The returned value will contain, in order, Charlie Sheen, between 0 and 2 intermediate nodes, and the unaliased endpoint.
