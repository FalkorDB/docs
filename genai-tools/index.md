- [GraphRAG-SDK](./graphrag-sdk.md): Build intelligent GraphRAG applications with FalkorDB and LLMs.
- [AG2](./ag2.md): Build multi-agent AI systems with AG2 (formerly AutoGen) and FalkorDB GraphRAG.
- [LangChain](./langchain.md): Integration with LangChain for AI agents with memory (Python and JavaScript/TypeScript).
- [LangGraph](./langgraph.md): Build stateful, multi-actor agentic applications with LangGraph.
- [LlamaIndex](./llamaindex.md): Simplify development of LLM-powered applications with LlamaIndex.
- [GraphRAG Toolkit](./graphrag-toolkit.md): AWS GraphRAG Toolkit integration for building knowledge graph applications.
