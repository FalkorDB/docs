> "FalkorDB has been a **game-changer** for our startup. Disappointed by Neo4j’s lack of support and slow performance, we turned to FalkorDB as a robust backend solution. Our wish? To run non-traversal queries with performance rivaling MongoDB or Postgres—something FalkorDB delivers where Neo4j fell short."
