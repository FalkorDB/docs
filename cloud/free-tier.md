# Free Tier
FalkorDB's free cloud tier gives you instant access to a graph database with multi-graph support and multi-tenancy capabilities. You can deploy on AWS or GCP with 100MB of storage and rely on community support to get started.

The free tier provides everything you need to explore FalkorDB and build initial prototypes. When your application grows and requires TLS security, VPC networking, high availability, automated backups, or dedicated support, you can upgrade to a paid plan that includes these enterprise features.
